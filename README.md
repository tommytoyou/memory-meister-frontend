# Memory Practice

The Memory Practice page hald thirty cards face down. The user must flip the cards over (They return to being face down within three seconds.) and recall where the matching card is to keep the pair face up. The countdown is sixty seconds. The objective is to match all of the f pairs (fifteen of them) within that time.
